                      That’s what’s cool about working with computers.  They don’t argue, they remember everything, and they don’t drink all your beer.

                    I've always been inspired by various successful people like steve jobs etc
                    I never had all the resources I have access to now as I grew up and being a computer scientist was
                    really something I didnt know existed so my dreams that I drafted as I got exposed to the world of knowledge and persistance
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full stack web developer</li>
                        <li>Cyber security researcher</li>
                        <li>Systems integration engineer</li>
                    </ul>

                      I like quite alot of things in life that have to do with the constantly evolving techology
                      so this has got me having some sort of a daily routen that I'm looping in.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Do mathematics for computer science</li>
                      <li>Check on friends</li>
                      <li>Go tutoring</li>

                  <p>
                      I'm very much in love with computers as mentioned before and I'm currently doing an online course
                      in machine learning at <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT online courses</a> and thus
                      far it has been a tough journey as I have alot of other stuff aside.
                      <br>
                      I have also been into different competitions like
                      <ul>
                          <li>Tertiary maths olympiad</li>
                          <li>Standard bank IT challenge</li>
