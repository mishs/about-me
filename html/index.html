          <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I was born on the 20th of December in 1996 at Witbank polly clinic ,
                I grew up under my grand mother's supervision.<br>
                As I grew up , I faced alot of sicknesses and once gave on life due to the countless times I often got sick
                and worsed of all My granny was too old to do most of the medically required stuff...

            <h3>Academic life</h3>
            <p>
                My academic background is kinda hectic because I'm one of those kids <br>
                that would often get caught up in the midst of an arguement between family and relatives
                and ended up changing school almost every year.
                <br>
                I started my grade 1 - 4 in Swaziland and came to South Africa in 2008 around December and the following year
                I got registered at Nancy Shiba primary school where I did my grade 5 - 7 and progressed to a secondary school
                which is also located not far from the primary school.
                I did my grade 8 and the following year went back to swaziland and did my grade 9 then back again to the same school
                and continued till matric.
